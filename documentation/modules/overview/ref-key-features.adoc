== Kafka capabilities

Kafka's data stream-processing capabilities and component architecture offer:

* High-throughput, low-latency data sharing for microservices and other applications
* Guaranteed message ordering
* Message rewind/replay from data storage to reconstruct application state
* Message compaction to remove outdated records in a key-value log
* Horizontal scalability within a cluster
* Data replication to enhance fault tolerance
* High-volume data retention for immediate access

== Kafka use cases

Kafka's capabilities make it ideal for:

* Event-driven architectures
* Event sourcing to log application state changes
* Message brokering
* Website activity tracking
* Operational monitoring through metrics
* Log collection and aggregation
* Commit logs for distributed systems
* Stream processing for real-time data responses
